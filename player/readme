=== The player directory

This file gies a brief description of the contents in the player directory

Player files are ASCII text files organized in separate directories.
The average player file is 10K long.  You may compress the playerfiles
using 'gzip -9 -r *' in the player directory periodically.  The server
will uncompress as needed and leave them untouched afterwards until
you compress them manually again.
